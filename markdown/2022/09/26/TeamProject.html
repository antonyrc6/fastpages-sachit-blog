<p>Our team project will be similar to the clock app on iphone where there are many functions. These functions include showing the time through the use of a digital clock, timer, stopwatch, and showing different times in different time zones. All of these functions essentially serve the same purpose in different ways: To allow the user to keep track of time.</p>
