<p>Just like in trimester 1, the idea of the Night at the museum is the same. Night at the museum is a day where people can art pieces from different art classes are presented for people to see and admire. These pieces set on display are the culmination of lots of hard work and dedication put in by many students. This day is purposed to showing off the accomplishments of these students.</p>

<p>The first class I explored was computer animation. Most of the projects displayed where scenes created by students related to donuts. There were many cool scenes created that I found interesting. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages-sachit-blog/images/coolscene.png" alt="" title="Another cool scene"></p>

<p>There were also many other good projects, but there weren’t quite as good as the holographic donut. Here is another cool project that I saw:</p>

<p>Another class I went to was studio art. There were many different paintings and art pieces plastered against the walls of the class. As I walked around the classroom looking at all the paintings, I could tell that every student has put in a lot of effort into their project. Here are some paintings I found interesting:</p>

<p>Next, I went to the ceramics classroom to see what students in that class created. I saw many unique and interesting projects, but the one that intrigued me the most was this octopus:</p>

<p>Lastly, I also was able to ask another group about what their project is about and how it works. The Tetris game works by using a grid with each tile being assigned to the same number value. As the Tetris block moves down the grid, arrow keys are used to move the block left and right, or the block is rotated, the blocks on the grid that the Tetris block occupies changes to a different number highlighting the Tetris block as it moves.</p>

<p>Overall, I not only had a fun time presenting what I had worked on with my project, but I also had fun seeing other computer science projects and art from an assortment of other classes. Some of my favorite classes that I visited were photography, jazz, and studio art. I had a good time and I hope I could have an experience like this again in the future.</p>
