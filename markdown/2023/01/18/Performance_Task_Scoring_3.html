<p>Just like last few performance task scoring assignments, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I’ve gotten used to grading the programs based on College Board’s criteria. After comparing , I realized that I was way more lenient with my grading than College Board. Just like with the other performance task scoring assignments, I became a lot more familiar with the different categories College Board uses to grade the performance tasks. I also understand that when you write your written response, make your program, and create your video, you have to pay a lot of attention to detail and make sure you’re meeting all the criteria. With the 3 create performance task grading assignments I have completed, I have a greater understanding of what it takes to create a program, written response, and videos that meet College Board’s criteria.</p>
