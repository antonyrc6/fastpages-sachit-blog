<p>Overall, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. After looking at these performance tasks and seeing how College Board graded them with their rubric, I can see how careful you have to be about meeting each and every requirement on the rubric. Even if you miss one small thing, you won’t receive any credit for the category. Knowing this, I will be sure to review the rubric many times to make sure my performance task has everything it needs to score well. I also wanted to mention that I think that both of these examples were really well made.</p>
