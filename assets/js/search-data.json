            "content": "3.12 Hacks Part 1 . Problem 1: . Answer: PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } . This is the answer because both distance and time are needed and the value of distance/time needs to be calculated to determine the average speed. . Problem 2: . Answer: True, nothing will be displayed . Even though volume have the value of IM MAD!!!, nothing will be displayed because they is no DISPLAY() statement. . Problem 3: . Answer: The correct answers are code snippets 1 and 4. . Code snippet 1 is correct because it directly adds the carbon footprints from each flight to get the total carbon footprint. . Code snippet 4 is also correct because it assigns each carbon footprint to a variable which are then added together to get the total carbon footprint. . 3.12 Hacks Part 2 . Problem 1: . Answer: The value of a is 729. . First, the value of b is found by multiplying 9 and 9 which is 81. Next, the value of a is found by multiply the value of b and c together which is 81 x 9 which is 729. . Problem 2: . “cost ⟵ 173 tax - 10%” was written poorly and was very confusing. At first I thought cost was assigned to the entire value on the right. But after a long time of getting confused, I realized cost was assigned to 173 and tax was assigned to 10%. . Answer: The cost is 190.3 . First, we know that temp is 100 + percentTaxed which is 110. Next, temp is assigned to temp/100 which is 110/100 which is 1.1. Lastly, cost is equal to the previously given value of cost multiplied by the new value for temp which gives us a value of 190.3 (173 x 1.1) for cost. . Problem 3: . Answer: The temperature in celsius is about 39.4 degrees Celsius. . First, Celsius is set to the value of temperature - 32 which is 71. Next, Celsius is set to the value of Celsius x 5/9 which is about 39.4. . 3.13 Hacks Parts 1 and 2 . Problem 1: . PROCEDURE CurrentHighest(currentrbyards, totalGames, toprbyardspg) { currentrbyardspg &lt;– currentrbyards/totalGames IF currentrbyardspg &gt; toprbyardspg { toprbyardspg &lt;– currentrbyardspg } return(toprbyardspg) } DISPLAY(CurrentHighest(1260, 12, 100)) . Problem 2: . PROCEDURE MoveAPlus { move_forward() rotate_left() move_forward() move_forward() rotate_right() move_forward() move_forward() move_forward() rotate_left() move_forward() move_forward() rotate_left() move_forward() move_forward() rotate_right() move_forward() rotate_left() move_forward() move_forward() } . Problem 3: . Answer: B. PROCEDURE MyList . This is the correct answer because “procedure” needs to be in all caps and only part of the name of the procedure should be in caps. . Problem 4: . Assuming beach ball starts facing forward: . PROCEDURE MoveBeachBall { rotate_left() move_forward() rotate_right() repeat 6 times { move_forward() } rotate_left() move_forward() move_forward() } .",

Question 5 . Since this list is already ordered from least to greatest, we can skip this step. To find the number 69 in the list in question 4, we would first start by finding the middle element. Since there are an even number of elements in this list, there would be no middle element, so we would use the next element from the middle of the list which in this case would be 6. Since 6 is less than 69, we know that 69 is in the second half of the list with all the numbers greater than 6. Since the middle element of this half is 11 and is less than 69, we know that the number 69 is in the part of the list after the element 11. Since there is only one element in this part of the list, we know that this element is 69 and we have found the desired value 69. . Question 6 . Diagram . Question 7 . Ordered List: [“store”,”Market”,”Walmart”,Target”,”Ralphs”] . Arranging them in alphabetical order was the best way I could think of to get the list ready for binary search. I first thought of ordering them by length of each string, but then I realized this wouldn&#39;t work because some of the strings have the same length. . Question 8 . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because binary search removes half the elements every time which is very effective in pinpointing exactly where the desired element is. Sequential is usually less efficient because if the desired element is towards the end of the list or the list is very long, all the previous elements would have to be checked before reaching the desired element. Therefore, sequential search usually takes more checks to reach the desired value than binary search. . Question 9 . Binary Search Tree . If we are searching for the value 36, this will take 2 checks because the first middle index will be found to be 3 because (1+5)/2 = 3. Next the second middle index will be found to be 2 because (1+3)/2 = 2. Since index 2 is the value 36, 36 will be found on the second check. .",

I still don’t understand why the answer to this question is “FOR loops” because since the loop will iterate over a list until the user inputs ‘quit’, this represents a while loop because the loop ends when a condition is met.

Additionally, blog about any missed questions, or what you learned from this lesson. . 3.5 Hacks . Binary Practice . Using psuedocode operators determine if the statements are true or false. The number type will be indicated in parentheses. . 1. 90(D) = 1000(B) . A. True | B. False | . ☆ My answer: 1000(B) = 8(D) ≠ 90(D). Since the 2 values aren&#39;t equal to each other, the answer is false. . 2. 10(D) ≠ 0110(B) . A. True | B. False | . ☆ My answer: 0110(B) = 6(D) ≠ 10(D). Since the 2 values aren&#39;t equal to each other, the answer is true because the question is asking if they aren&#39;t equal to each other. . 3. 56(D) ≥ 111000(B) . A. True | B. False | . ☆ My answer: 111000(B) = (8 + 16 + 32)(D) = 56(D) ≤ 56(D). Since this comparison can be satisfied when the 2 values are equal to each other (because 56(D) has to be greater than or equal to 111000(B)), the answer is true. . 3. 99(D) &lt; 1110011(B) . A. True | B. False | . ☆ My answer: 1110011(B) = (1 + 2 + 16 + 32 + 64)(D) = 115(D) &gt; 99(D). Since 1110011(B) is indeed greater than 99(D), the answer is true. .

Nice job! | Display | Please schedule a retake. | 75 | ☆ My answer: Since result is set to the value of 75 and 75 &lt; 80, Please schedule a retake. will be displayed. . 2. How is an if statement different from an if-else statement. . Extra words. | An if statement will only go through a process if a condition is met. An if-else statement will go through code no matter the conditions. | They are the exact same. | An if statement will go through the entire code segment every single time and the if-else statement is always used in an algorithm, no matter the conditions. | ☆ My answer: The answer is #2 because an if statement will only be run if the condition for it is met, while an if-else statement will be run no matter what because the either the if statement or else statement has to be true. . 3. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Ben wants to check his bank account. If his car fuel is full, he will go to the bank. Otherwise, he will go home. If he goes to the bank, he will withdraw money only if his balance is above $1000. . If statement | If-else statement | ☆ My answer: The answer is #2 because both if statements and else statements are needed in this situation. . 4. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Luke wants to play basketball. If it is sunny outside he will go to the park to play basketball. .

When I ran this command, I received a parsing error which means that the software can’t understand what I’m trying to do. This means that there is either something wrong with my formatting or the code. . Checking for Formatting Issues: . I searched up the error I received and read through a few forums on Stack Overflow. While reading through the comments, I noticed that most people were receiving the parsing error because they had unnecessary spaces in their code. . A few Methods I used to Check for any Unnecessary Spaces: . I even ran my code through a YAML validator to make sure there weren’t any mistakes in my code that violate syntax or incorrect indentations. . I even used the vi command to open a text editor. After creating it, I typed so I could see if there are any spaces that need to be removed. However, there weren’t any unnecessary spaces in the code. . Checking for Mistakes in my Code: . To check for mistakes in my code, I made sure to copy the correct template for the code and change the things that were needed to be changed. I changed the port number, the image name, and I added the directory to my project. I also checked with a few friends to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. . Asking Teacher for Help: . When I asked Mr Yeung for help, he told me to use the “sudo nano config.yml” command to edit the config.yml file and fix any problems in the code without using VSCode. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get my problem resolved because class was ending and he needed to leave. .",

How is a Program Developed (Video 2)? . Programs are usually developed by teams of people so many inputs and ideas can be provided.

Documentation . Programmers create program documentation to describe the overall program, list program specifications, describe parts of the program, and list contributors/authors of the program | Documentation throughout development of the program: At the beginning: list specifications | During: keep track of process | After: explain the overall process | Documentation throughout the development can improve the efficiency of the programming process, programmers’ ability to test and refine the program, and programmers’ response to bugs | . | .

Even though students at Yale are very privileged to be at a place like Yale, they are so stressed and filled with anxiety because they are overwhelmed and incredibly busy all the time. | Here are some ways that Yale students are negatively by stress: Students are so stressed that they can’t make use of all the good opportunities presented to them. | Students are too stressed to enjoy the small pleasures and do things that students love(ex: reading a book). | . | . College Student Mental Health Statistics (2009 Study) . 40% of college students report more than the average level of stress | About 1/3 of students report being so depressed that it’s difficult to function | Over 40% often feel hopeless | A little under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety | Over 50% report often feeling very lonely | Over 80% say they fell overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do every day | . Psychology and the Good Life Class . Laurie Santos created this course to help students understand and deal with stress and anxiety in college | There were two parts to the Psychology and the Good Life Course: Understanding positive psychology and how to make the positive changes in your life | Actually practicing the good habits (this is important because it’s one thing to understand what you should be doing to improve your mental health, but it’s another to actually implement the key ideas into your own life) | . | This course performed so well that it became the most popular course at Yale. The reason why this course performed so well was because many students were having trouble dealing with their stress and anxiety | . | Important insights that students can take away from the course: Your level of well being can be improved through the correct practices and measures taken to improve it. | We think that our life circumstances (such as occupation and salary) matter a lot, but they don’t matter nearly as much as we think | Sleep is very important for brain development and well being (and high school and college students aren’t getting enough) | It’s important to be aware of the present moment because it enables you to notice and enjoy the good things in your life.

            "content": "Program Purpose and Function . An idea I came up with for the Create Performance Task project is a Math Quiz game. In this game there will be three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. There will be a random math question (based on difficulty selected) shown at the top of the screen. Below the question, there will be many boxes (one of them containing the answer) scattered across the screen. Every time you select the correct answer, you get 1000 points (for getting the question right) and the screen changes to show the next question. You can get the questions wrong infinite times, but each time you select and incorrect answer, your total score will decrease by 100 points. There will be a timer in the corner of the screen showing the amount of time left until the game ends. The goal of the game is to get the most points that you can. . Data Abstraction . Many variables will be used to store different values in the program. Some variables that will be very useful are a variable for the score, a variable for the timer, variables for the answers scattered across the screen, and variables for the lists for each difficulty. . Managing Complexity . To manage the complexity of my code, I will add the questions into a list and randomly generate questions from the list. There will be a list for each difficulty level. . Procedural Abstraction . To manage the difficulty, there will be three different buttons to select how hard the user wants the quiz to be. The list that will be accessed during the quiz depends on the difficulty level selected. For example, if easy mode is selected, questions from the list containing the easy mode questions will be asked. . Algorithm Implementation . A way I can implement an algorithm is by including a percent representing how many questions the user got correct without selecting an incorrect answer. . Testing . To test the project, I will run all three difficult modes and test whether the point system works. I will also make sure that the game ends and displays the final score when the timer ends. .",

            "content": "Quiz Description . My quiz is a quiz about animals. The quiz contains 3 questions and you are given an unlimited number of attempts to complete the quiz. Since you are given an unlimited number of attempts, there is no score given after the quiz is completed. When an incorrect answer is chosen, the user will be taken to a screen telling them they got the question incorrect and they need to try again. When the correct answer is chosen, the user will be taken to a screen telling them they got the question correct and they will proceed to the next question. Once all the questions have been answered correctly, the user will be taken to the final screen telling them they have have completed the quiz. . Successes . I had many successes while making my animal quiz. One success that I had was that I was able to add many images that related to the questions. These images will not only add more to my quiz, but they also make the quiz more entertaining. Another success I had was using buttons to allow the user to advance through the quiz. I like the use of buttons because they are a much cleaner way of selecting an answer than just clicking an image (method used in teacher’s example). . Challenges . Not only did I have many successes, but I also had a few challenges while making the quiz. My biggest challenge was trying to figure out how I should make my incorrect and correct systems. Finally, I decided to make incorrect and correct screens for each question that appeared depending on whether the user gets the question correct or incorrect. Another challenge that I had was with finding images with a transparent background. After watching a video explaining how to find images with transparent backgrounds on Google, I was able to good images that worked well with my quiz. . Discoveries . Throughout my journey of creating my first quiz with JavaScript, I made many discoveries. One discovery I made was that you can personalize your quiz by changing the theme of it. I selected Under the Sea” as my theme. Another discovery that I made was that buttons can be used to progress through different screens. Speaking of screens, I discovered that I could utilize many screens including incorrect screens, correct screens, and screens containing questions and answers. . Link to Quiz . Here is a link to my quiz: Quiz .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
