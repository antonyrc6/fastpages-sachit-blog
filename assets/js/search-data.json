For this question, I wasn’t sure what the word “heuristic” meant because I had never heard it before. After searching up what it means, I chose the answer that made the most sense with what I had just learned. . Question 50: . . For this question, I knew that it was asking me to convert hexadecimal (base 16) number 56 to decimal, but I didn’t know how to do this without using a calculator. With a calculator, I found that the decimal value is 86 which corresponds to the letter V. . Reflection: . Overall, I found this quiz to be pretty doable and I understood all the topics I was tested on. Although I found a few problems challenging (like the problems I listed above), I was able to understand even these questions. I also found it fun to solve these problems because they made me use my brain and challenged me. .",

Drones Benefits: Drones can be used as a hobby or form of entertainment | They can be useful in search and rescue | they can also be used to take pictures and videos | . | Harmful Effects: They can be used to spy on people | They can be used to commit crimes | There is also a possibility that they can be hijacked and be used for evil purposes | . | . | ChatGPT Benefits: We can learn a lot about different topics from ChatGPT that we might not be able to get from Google ChatGPT finds information that is more specific to your request than Google | . | ChatGPT can be a useful tool if you don’t understand what something is and want a general understanding of what it is | . | Harmful Effects: The easy access to information gained from ChatGPT can lead to misuse Students can use ChatGPT to cheat on assignments and get answers to questions that they should be coming up with themselves | We can claim work created by ChatGPT as our own | . | It’s possible for the AI to find inaccurate information from a source that is not credible | . | . | Dopamine Positives: Occasional dopamine can be good as it makes us feel good and happy | . | Negatives: Excessive dopamine can result in addictions Addictions can take over and ruin your life | Example of Addiction and Excessive Dopamine: Anthony Rosner, who was 17 years old, had an addiction of playing World of Warcraft | This addiction let to him neglecting his schoolwork, relationships, health, and even his hygiene | . | . | Constantly releasing dopamine can also reduce the pleasure gained from an activity | . | . | . Big Idea 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects Reflection . 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . Simulations: Beneficial: Simulations are beneficial because they allow us to use previously collected data to simulate possible outcomes for something. | Harmful Effects: In some cases, simulations might not account for every detail which might create a crucial miscalculation in the results (very rare). | . | Smartphones: Beneficial: Smartphones are beneficial because they are portable and they provide us with easy access to a lot of information. | Harmful Effects: One harmful effect of smartphones is that they can be addicting. With the numerous apps created solely for the purpose of entertainment, it’s very easy for one to get addicted to their phone. Especially with the rise of social media, more and more people are glued to their phones. | . | Social Media: Beneficial: With social media, people can meet and make friends online and stay connected with their friends. | Harmful Effects: Like I mentioned before, social media is very addictive. Many people have an uncontrollable urge to constantly check their phone for notifications from social media platforms. Social media can also take away from real in person relationships when people are always on their phones. | . | . 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Dopamine issues are absolutely real and are a big problem. Problems with dopamine are affecting countless people around the world. For example, Anthony Rosner, who was 17 years old, had an addiction of playing World of Warcraft. He spent up to 18 hours a day, every day playing this game. This went on for nearly 2 years. This addiction led him to neglect his schoolwork, relationships, health, and even his hygiene. We can see that in this person’s case, this dopamine issue resulted in a negative impact on Rosner’s studies and success in high school. . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide Class Discussion Notes . Some religious groups choose not to use technology | Poorer or rural areas may not have much access to technology | Even in San Diego county alone, there are distinctions in many categories between the Northern and Southern population | During distance learning, many schools did not have access to technology making it hard to teach with social distancing | Some countries may have different or restricted access For example, China often restricts access to certain services | . | Disadvantages of not having access to technology: People without much access to technology would not be able to keep track of the current events happening around them | These people would also not have access to the abundant information available on the internet | Without technology, these people also wouldn’t be able to communicate with other people over long distances | . | . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide Reflection . 1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . One can empower themselves in a digital world by learning as much as they can from technology and implementing what they learned in their lives. For example, if you are interested in being a programmer and want to pursue that as a career, you can make use of the internet and learn about what coding is about and how to do it. In our digital world has given rise to many opportunities and it’s important that you take some of these opportunities and learn more about different topics. . 2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by showing how useful and great the internet is. If someone does not believe in long term gratification and the benefits of learning more to be more successful and happy in the future, then it’s important that you explain these benefits. In Del Norte, we have the option to take any class and join any club or other extracurricular activities we want. We can take advantage of this and encourage people to challenge themselves with classes they take and try different extracurricular activities. . 3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . In my opinion paper does not limit digital empowerment. In fact, paper can be a great tool for digital empowerment because it’s more efficient to make diagrams and visual projects on paper because of how fast and easy it is. A barrier present at Del Norte that blocks digital empowerment is can be how many sites are restricted. Even though this is not a very big problem and actually provides more good than harm, it can be frustrating when you are trying to learn more about something and the website you go to is blocked by the school. Overall, it is evident that there aren’t many barriers to digital empowerment because digital use is growing with each coming day. . 5.1 and 5.2 Canvas Questions . 1. Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit . Our project offers the user with a list of buildings with their pictures and descriptions about them, so people can decide where they want to travel to based on which building they want to visit. | Our project will make it easy for the user to plan their vacation to visit a famous building as we have many features that will accommodate for the user’s every need. | Different users who speak and understand different languages will be able to use our site with our translator. | 2. Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. . There aren’t really any harmful effects of our project, but a drawback is that the user can’t actually purchase the tickets for their flight on our site. Our website’s purpose is only to help the user plan for their flight. . 3. Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . Internet blockers at school are useful because they restrict students from going to sites that they shouldn’t be or aren’t related to school. Internet blockers can also protect students from malicious sites that want to steal information. These internet blocker can also be disadvantageous as there might be some sites that aren’t bad and might be useful to students that are blocked. The lack of admin password on lab machines at school can be advantageous as it’s easier for admins to get access the computers without having to type in a password. This easy access to admin permissions without needing to know a password makes it easier for unauthorized people to tamper with these admin permissions in ways that could harm the school. . 4. What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . I wouldn’t face many problems with the digital divide because I don’t have many problems with my access to technology. I have all the technological resources I need to learn more about different topics and have access to all the other benefits of having technology. For others, however, who might not have as much access to technology, it will be hard for them to do much in a world that is mainly focused on technology. In this day and age, it’s crucial to have access to technology. . Big Ideas 5.3 and 5.4: . Big Idea 5.3 Computing Bias . Intentional or Purposeful bias (Crossover Group Up, 10 minutes) . TikTok is usually used by and marketed towards younger ages It attracts younger ages through the way the short videos capture the attention of these kids | Also, the music and bright colors also help to captivate these audiences | . | Facebook is often used by older users as it is used more for communication rather than entertainment | People use facebook to share their life with others and learn about what others are doing and it’s not as addicting as Tiktok TikTok is made to be addicting to young users with the way it recommends videos in a particular way that makes users want to watch more and more | . | Even though this addiction that TikTok can cause is harmful to the user of the app, it is what makes the company a lot of money | Since this app can be harmful to its users, I believe that it should be corrected and made to be not as addicting . | Virtual assistants might have female voices because they are perceived as more trustworthy, soothing and pleasant | Also, these voices might be used to attract male audiences | In these ways, this is definitely good business and had definitely helped these companies that create these virtual assistants | I also don’t believe that the overuse of female voices in virtual assistants is harmful | . Are HP Computers Racist? . I believe that the owner of the computer did not think this was intentional. I hypothesize that this happened with improper testing. I think that the majority of the testers of the camera were white and the camera wasn’t tested by enough darker people to recognize them as people. To produce a better outcome, a wider range of people should be tested, so the camera would be able to detect everyone. It’s imperative that this problem is corrected because this can cause a lot of problems and harm. It can even be emotionally hurtful as some people might question their humanity. . Big Idea 5.4 Crowdsourcing . What is Crowdsourcing? . Crowdsourcing is the practice of a lot of different people contributing information for a task or project | An example of crowdsourcing is different people contributing different information that comes together in a Wikipedia page | . Evidence of Crowdsourcing . Wikipedia is a major example of something that uses crowdsourcing Wikipedia works with many people contributing information on a single topic and this information coming together to form an article | Sometimes this information can be inaccurate because even people who are inexperienced and not credible can add information to the page | . | For crypto currency, the 3 step validation of exchanges of money provided by 3 different miners is an example of crowdsourcing | For COVID data, different places can contribute their data about all the different aspects of this topic | . Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing . I mostly use APIs from RapidAPI because we learned about that last trimester. We learned about an API that contained COVID data and we learned how to convert the data into json format. For this project, I have also used 2 APIs (one to convert a city’s name to its latitude and longitude coordinates and the other to use the latitude and longitude coordinates to find the nearest airport). In this project, I learned how to parse through the 2 APIs to get the data I am interested in. . With Github, we can see other student’s projects and see how they did certain things. For example, if someone highlighted something in their blog and I wanted to know how they did it, I could find their blog on Github and see how they did it. With this, it’s possible to not only learn from the internet, but from other students as well. . 3.4 Hacks . 1. CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . A crowdsourcing idea that we can use for CSP could be creating a big project with everyone inputting their own features. Since everyone in CSP know how to code at least something, we would be able to get many inputs and the project would come together well. Also, if people need help with the part of the project they are working on, they can ask another student for help. For our project, we can ask people about some buildings they want to visit so we can include them in our list of famous building and descriptions for them. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? | The previous crowdsourcing project I mentioned probably wouldn’t be better with the entire school, because inexperienced people might contribute work that makes the project worse. It’s better for people who know what they are doing to contribute rather than people who don’t. Since the idea I wrote about in the first question isn’t related to CSP, we can ask anyone from Del Norte about famous building they want to visit. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. | At Night at the Museum, all of the pieces of our project would have come together. We can ask someone to input their current location and where they want to visit (based on the location of the building they want to visit). Then, with the Google API, we can show them their current location and their destination on a map. This will probably impress the teachers during finals week. .",

Just like last few performance task scoring assignments, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I’ve gotten used to grading the programs based on College Board’s criteria. After comparing , I realized that I was way more lenient with my grading than College Board. Just like with the other performance task scoring assignments, I became a lot more familiar with the different categories College Board uses to grade the performance tasks. I also understand that when you write your written response, make your program, and create your video, you have to pay a lot of attention to detail and make sure you’re meeting all the criteria. With the 3 create performance task grading assignments I have completed, I have a greater understanding of what it takes to create a program, written response, and videos that meet College Board’s criteria. .",

Just like last time, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I was surprised with how College Board decided to grade some of the categories and that their scoring different from mine at times. With this assignment, I think I learned a lot about the different categories College Board uses to grade the performance tasks. Also, I came to realize that it takes a lot of work to grade the performance tasks because one small error can result in a 0. This made it challenging to figure out whether the category should receive a 0 or a 1. With the 2 create performance task grading assignments I have completed, I have a greater understanding of what it takes to fulfill the requirements of each category and how selective College Board is with their grading. .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

After looking at these performance tasks and seeing how College Board graded them with their rubric, I can see how careful you have to be about meeting each and every requirement on the rubric. Even if you miss one small thing, you won’t receive any credit for the category. Knowing this, I will be sure to review the rubric many times to make sure my performance task has everything it needs to score well. I also wanted to mention that I think that both of these examples were really well made. .",

            "content": "(1) Reflection . Thorough notes or summary that reflects understanding of today&#39;s lesson. . I learned many things from this lesson on sections 14-15. I learned about how libraries make coding more efficient because prewritten code can be used to simplify a program. I also learned about how procedures can be created so you don&#39;t have to use a series of commands to do something every time. For example, creating a procedure for moving a robot backwards and using it when necessary is much more efficient that using something like &quot;rotate right, rotate right, move forward&quot; every time you want to make the robot move backwards. I learned about how documentation gives an explanation of what a certain procedure does. Lastly, I learned about the random library and all of its functions that allows us to randomly generate values in different ways. . Notes . Libraries contain prewritten code that can be used by programmers | Programmers use libraries to make their code more efficient and easier to follow | Documentation allows for programmers to understand what each procedure or function does | An API is a way for computer programs to communicate with each other and access information | The random library is an example of a library that allows you to use different functions that allow you to generate random values | Examples of functions present in the random library: random.randint(a,b): chooses a random integer between a and b (inclusive) | random.choice(list): chooses a random element from a list | random.shuffle(list): randomly rearranges the elements in a list | random.randrange(start, stop, step): similar to random.randint with the minimum and maximum values, but random.randrange needs a &quot;step&quot; parameter which takes in the increment by which the possible values increases by (default increment value of 1) | . | . (2) Multiple Choice . What does the random(a,b) function generate? | A. A random integer from a to be exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. . ☆ My answer: The answer is choice B because this function will randomly generate an integer from a to b (including the values a and b). . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . ☆ My answer: The correct answer is choice A. This is because x is the starting or minimum value, y is the stopping or maximum value, and z is the step or value that the possible integers increment by. . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . ☆ My answer: The answer to this question is A because all of the other functions exist. The function random.random generates a random float between 0 and 1. The function random.shuffle randomly rearranges the elements of the list it takes in. Lastly, random.randint generates a random integer. . (3) Short Answer Questions . What is the advantage of using libraries? | ☆ My answer: Using libraries is advantageous because they contain prewritten code that can be used by programmers to make their code more efficient and easier to follow. . Write a thorough documentation of the following code. | import random names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) num_items = len(names) random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . Sachit is going to buy the meal today! . Documentation: The input() function prompts the user with a statement that the user needs to respond to. In this case, the user is prompted to enter everybody&#39;s names. The split() function will separate the names with commas. The len() function is used to find the length of the list of names. The random.randint() is used to generate a number from (representing index of the list) 0 to the length of the list minus 1. The person who will pay is selected using the randomly generated index of the list. The final print statement will print the person selected and states that they will buy the meal. . (4) Coding Challenges! . REQUIRED: Create programs in python to complete the two task&lt;/p&gt; Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names | &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; import random names = [&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot;, &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot;, &quot;Henry&quot;, &quot;Noah&quot;, &quot;Benjamin&quot;, &quot;Luna&quot;, &quot;Christopher&quot;, &quot;Jayden&quot;, &quot;Lucas&quot;, &quot;Elijah&quot;, &quot;Sophia&quot;, &quot;Abigail&quot;, &quot;Charlotte&quot;, &quot;Mason&quot;] selected = [] checkDuplicates = [] # to make sure there aren&#39;t any duplicate names generated for i in range(5): generated = random.choice(names) while generated in checkDuplicates: a = random.choice(names) checkDuplicates.append(generated) selected.append(generated) print(&quot;5 Random Names:&quot;) for name in selected: print(name) . 5 Random Names: Elijah Sophia Charlotte Jayden Abigail .

Player 1 Sum: 7 Player 2 Sum: 8 Player 2 is the winner! . Extra Credit . Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: . No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . import random directions = [&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] initialDirection = random.choice(directions) # randomly chooses direction print(&quot;Initial Direction: &quot; + initialDirection) initialPosition = random.randint(1,25) # integer generated represents square number print(&quot;Initial Position: &quot; + str(initialPosition)) goalPosition = random.randint(1,25) while goalPosition == initialPosition: # while loops ensures initial position can&#39;t be same as goal position goalPosition = random.randint(1,25) print(&quot;Goal Position: &quot; + str(goalPosition)) obstacles = [] # list that will hold all obstacle square numbers checkDuplicates = [] for i in range(12): # generates 12 obstacles a = random.randint(1,25) while a in checkDuplicates: # makes sure a is not already present in list to ensure unique obstacle squares a = random.randint(1,25) while a == initialPosition or a == goalPosition: # makes sure a is not equal to initial or goal squares a = random.randint(1,25) checkDuplicates.append(a) obstacles.append(a) print(&quot;Location of Obstacles: &quot; + str(obstacles)) . Initial Direction: up Initial Position: 5 Goal Position: 9 Location of Obstacles: [15, 8, 12, 24, 20, 21, 19, 18, 3, 1, 2, 4] . Robot Course for Code Above . &lt;/div&gt; .",

            "content": "Notes: . An algorithm can be made more efficient by reducing the number of steps needed to accomplish the task This is why different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies | . | A way to informally measure an algorithm&#39;s efficiency is by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes | Approximate solutions are found when problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficient algorithm for solving them | It is possible for there to be some solutions to an input of an undecidable problem | . Vocab: . Four Types of Algorithms: 1 Step: An integer being multiplied by a variable | 2 Step: An integer to the power of the variable | 3 Step: A variable multiplied by an integer, all raised to the power of 2 | 4 Step: A variable factorial | . | Decidable Problems: Problems for which algorithms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | Undecidable Problems: Problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | Constant Time: Algorithm that always takes a fixed number of steps, no matter how large the input size increases | Linear Time: Algorithm in which the number of steps increases in direct proportion to the input size | Quadratic Time: Algorithm where the number of steps increase in proportion to the input size squared | Exponential Time: Algorithm where the number of steps increases faster than a polynomial function of the input size | Polynomial Time: Any run time that does not increase faster than n^k | Superpolynomial Time: Any run time that does increase faster than n^k | Reasonable Time: Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or lower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) | Unreasonable Time: Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies | . HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable Problem: Decidable problems are problems for which algorithms can be written to produce an output for all possible inputs. . Example: . a = True if a == True: print(&quot;hello&quot;) else: print(&quot;bye&quot;) . hello . Undecidable Problem: Undecidable problems are problems for which no algorithm can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer. It is possible for there to be some algorithmic solutions for some inputs of an undecidable problem. . Example (Halting Problem): . def haltingProblem(): a = 0 x = 1 while a != 1: x = x + 1 print(x) haltingProblem() . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . ☆ My answer: The correct answer is C. This is because a 3 step algorithm needs to have an integer variable multiplied by another integer which is all raised to the power of 2 and (3 x 8)^2 meets these requirements. . HACK 3: Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Rewritten Code: . function peak_finder(list) { var peak = list[0]; for (i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i ++) { if (list[i] &gt; peak) { var peak = list[i]; } } return peak; # after all comparisons, returns highest value in list } var data = [5, 2, 3, 4, 9]; console.log(peak_finder(data)); # prints highest number in list (9) . Hack 3 Reflection: . This hack was a little confusing because I wasn&#39;t sure how to use binary search to make the code more efficient. Instead, since I&#39;m pretty sure the code is supposed to find the highest number in a list, I made code that compares elements in the list to each other to determine the highest value in the list. . HACK 4: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . Intead of writing my own code to sort the list, I can use the sort function to make the code more efficient: . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] data.sort() # sort function orders the data from least to greatest print(&quot;Sorted List:&quot;, data) . Sorted List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . HACK 5: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . Rewritten Code: . To do this, we can import permutations module from itertools package. . from itertools import permutations data = [1, 2, 3] allPermutations = permutations(data) for i in list(allPermutations): print (i) # prints all the permutations . (1, 2, 3) (1, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3) (2, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2) (3, 2, 1) . Extra Permutations . if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: abc = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] heap_permutation(abc, len(abc)) .

            "content": "3.12 Hacks Part 1 . Problem 1: . Answer: PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } . This is the answer because both distance and time are needed and the value of distance/time needs to be calculated to determine the average speed. . Problem 2: . Answer: True, nothing will be displayed . Even though volume have the value of IM MAD!!!, nothing will be displayed because they is no DISPLAY() statement. . Problem 3: . Answer: The correct answers are code snippets 1 and 4. . Code snippet 1 is correct because it directly adds the carbon footprints from each flight to get the total carbon footprint. . Code snippet 4 is also correct because it assigns each carbon footprint to a variable which are then added together to get the total carbon footprint. . 3.12 Hacks Part 2 . Problem 1: . Answer: The value of a is 729. . First, the value of b is found by multiplying 9 and 9 which is 81. Next, the value of a is found by multiply the value of b and c together which is 81 x 9 which is 729. . Problem 2: . “cost ⟵ 173 tax - 10%” was written poorly and was very confusing. At first I thought cost was assigned to the entire value on the right. But after a long time of getting confused, I realized cost was assigned to 173 and tax was assigned to 10%. . Answer: The cost is 190.3 . First, we know that temp is 100 + percentTaxed which is 110. Next, temp is assigned to temp/100 which is 110/100 which is 1.1. Lastly, cost is equal to the previously given value of cost multiplied by the new value for temp which gives us a value of 190.3 (173 x 1.1) for cost. . Problem 3: . Answer: The temperature in celsius is about 39.4 degrees Celsius. . First, Celsius is set to the value of temperature - 32 which is 71. Next, Celsius is set to the value of Celsius x 5/9 which is about 39.4. . 3.13 Hacks Parts 1 and 2 . Problem 1: . PROCEDURE CurrentHighest(currentrbyards, totalGames, toprbyardspg) { . currentrbyardspg &lt;– currentrbyards/totalGames .

Problem 3: . Answer: B. PROCEDURE MyList . This is the correct answer because “procedure” needs to be in all caps and only part of the name of the procedure should be in caps. . Problem 4: . Assuming beach ball starts facing forward: . PROCEDURE MoveBeachBall { . rotate_left() . move_forward() . rotate_right() . repeat 6 times { . move_forward() . } . rotate_left() . move_forward() . move_forward() . } .",

Question 5 . Since this list is already ordered from least to greatest, we can skip this step. To find the number 69 in the list in question 4, we would first start by finding the middle element. Since there are an even number of elements in this list, there would be no middle element, so we would use the next element from the middle of the list which in this case would be 6. Since 6 is less than 69, we know that 69 is in the second half of the list with all the numbers greater than 6. Since the middle element of this half is 11 and is less than 69, we know that the number 69 is in the part of the list after the element 11. Since there is only one element in this part of the list, we know that this element is 69 and we have found the desired value 69. . Question 6 . Diagram . Question 7 . Ordered List: [“store”,”Market”,”Walmart”,Target”,”Ralphs”] . Arranging them in alphabetical order was the best way I could think of to get the list ready for binary search. I first thought of ordering them by length of each string, but then I realized this wouldn&#39;t work because some of the strings have the same length. . Question 8 . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because binary search removes half the elements every time which is very effective in pinpointing exactly where the desired element is. Sequential is usually less efficient because if the desired element is towards the end of the list or the list is very long, all the previous elements would have to be checked before reaching the desired element. Therefore, sequential search usually takes more checks to reach the desired value than binary search. . Question 9 . Binary Search Tree . If we are searching for the value 36, this will take 2 checks because the first middle index will be found to be 3 because (1+5)/2 = 3. Next the second middle index will be found to be 2 because (1+3)/2 = 2. Since index 2 is the value 36, 36 will be found on the second check. .",

What is Night of the Museum?: Night at the museum is a day where art pieces from different art classes are presented for people to see and admire. The point of this event is for people to see how hard the students worked on their projects and enjoy looking at these projects. . The first class I explored was 3D animation. The projects displayed where scenes created by students related to donuts. The requirement for this project was that every image had to contain a donut in some way. The image I found most fascinating was the holographic donut. Here is a picture of it: . . There were also many other good projects, but there weren’t quite as good as the holographic donut. Here is another cool project that I saw: . . Another class I went to was studio art. There were many different paintings and art pieces plastered against the walls of the class. As I walked around the classroom looking at all the paintings, I could tell that every student has put in a lot of effort into their project. Here are some paintings I found interesting: . . Next, I went to the ceramics classroom to see what students in that class created. I saw many unique and interesting projects, but the one that intrigued me the most was this octopus: . . Lastly, I also was able to ask another group about what their project is about and how it works. The Tetris game works by using a grid with each tile being assigned to the same number value. As the Tetris block moves down the grid, arrow keys are used to move the block left and right, or the block is rotated, the blocks on the grid that the Tetris block occupies changes to a different number highlighting the Tetris block as it moves. . . Goals for Next Trimester . I want to learn about many new things that seem interesting to me. | I want to be more productive with my work during class time. | I want to be able to ask more questions in class to get my questions clarified. | I want to participate in more extra credit opportunities. | .",

This means that there is either something wrong with my formatting or the code. . Checking for Formatting Issues: . I searched up the error I received and read through a few forums on Stack Overflow. While reading through the comments, I noticed that most people were receiving the parsing error because they had unnecessary spaces in their code. . A few Methods I used to Check for any Unnecessary Spaces: . I even ran my code through a YAML validator to make sure there weren’t any mistakes in my code that violate syntax or incorrect indentations. . I even used the vi command to open a text editor. After creating it, I typed so I could see if there are any spaces that need to be removed. However, there weren’t any unnecessary spaces in the code. . Checking for Mistakes in my Code: . To check for mistakes in my code, I made sure to copy the correct template for the code and change the things that were needed to be changed. I changed the port number, the image name, and I added the directory to my project. I also checked with a few friends to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. . Asking Teacher for Help: . When I asked Mr Yeung for help, he told me to use the “sudo nano config.yml” command to edit the config.yml file and fix any problems in the code without using VSCode.

What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | .",

First, an idea is formed The program idea has a purpose and will be programmed for that specific purpose | A plan is created and specific steps are followed | Sometimes the development is exploratory and steps are dictated by what happens | . | Developers need to investigate the problem/purpose and reflect upon it Developers must follow requirements and constraints of the program and also the users interests with the program | Developers can investigate through the use of surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming, storyboarding the program, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and developing a testing strategy | Developers decide on program requirements that describe how the program should behave and includes a list of user interactions | Developers will test small parts (modules) of the program to make sure they are working before putting them together | Developers test the program at the micro (individual components) and macro (individual components working together as intended) levels | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . How is a Program Developed (Video 2)? . Programs are usually developed by teams of people so many inputs and ideas can be provided. Also different people are good at different tasks making team development the obvious choice of development. | Individuals/groups work on different functional components | Every member of the project needs to receive credit for their contributions Their names and contributions must be written in the documentation of the program | . | Many programs give credit through the use of comments because this makes it easy to find out and contact people in charge of a specific part of the code when there is a bug in that code segment | Many times developers use code segments, procedures, and algorithms that are written by people that are not involved in the project just so they don’t have to figure out how to do it themselves (think “there’s no point in reinventing the wheel”) The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | . | . Documentation . Programmers create program documentation to describe the overall program, list program specifications, describe parts of the program, and list contributors/authors of the program | Documentation throughout development of the program: At the beginning: list specifications | During: keep track of process | After: explain the overall process | Documentation throughout the development can improve the efficiency of the programming process, programmers’ ability to test and refine the program, and programmers’ response to bugs | . | .

Even though students at Yale are very privileged to be at a place like Yale, they are so stressed and filled with anxiety because they are overwhelmed and incredibly busy all the time. | Here are some ways that Yale students are negatively by stress: Students are so stressed that they can’t make use of all the good opportunities presented to them. | Students are too stressed to enjoy the small pleasures and do things that students love(ex: reading a book). | . | . College Student Mental Health Statistics (2009 Study) . 40% of college students report more than the average level of stress | About 1/3 of students report being so depressed that it’s difficult to function | Over 40% often feel hopeless | A little under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety | Over 50% report often feeling very lonely | Over 80% say they fell overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do every day | . Psychology and the Good Life Class . Laurie Santos created this course to help students understand and deal with stress and anxiety in college | There were two parts to the Psychology and the Good Life Course: Understanding positive psychology and how to make the positive changes in your life | Actually practicing the good habits (this is important because it’s one thing to understand what you should be doing to improve your mental health, but it’s another to actually implement the key ideas into your own life) | . | This course performed so well that it became the most popular course at Yale. The reason why this course performed so well was because many students were having trouble dealing with their stress and anxiety | . | Important insights that students can take away from the course: Your level of well being can be improved through the correct practices and measures taken to improve it. | We think that our life circumstances (such as occupation and salary) matter a lot, but they don’t matter nearly as much as we think | Sleep is very important for brain development and well being (and high school and college students aren’t getting enough) | It’s important to be aware of the present moment because it enables you to notice and enjoy the good things in your life. This can be practiced with practices like meditation. | It’s important to prioritize time over money | . | .",

            "title": "Create Performance Task",
            "content": "Program Purpose and Function . An idea I came up with for the Create Performance Task project is a Math Quiz game. In this game there will be three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. There will be a random math question (based on difficulty selected) shown at the top of the screen. Below the question, there will be many boxes (one of them containing the answer) scattered across the screen. Every time you select the correct answer, you get 1000 points (for getting the question right) and the screen changes to show the next question. You can get the questions wrong infinite times, but each time you select and incorrect answer, your total score will decrease by 100 points. There will be a timer in the corner of the screen showing the amount of time left until the game ends. The goal of the game is to get the most points that you can. . Data Abstraction . Many variables will be used to store different values in the program. Some variables that will be very useful are a variable for the score, a variable for the timer, variables for the answers scattered across the screen, and variables for the lists for each difficulty. . Managing Complexity . To manage the complexity of my code, I will add the questions into a list and randomly generate questions from the list. There will be a list for each difficulty level. . Procedural Abstraction . To manage the difficulty, there will be three different buttons to select how hard the user wants the quiz to be. The list that will be accessed during the quiz depends on the difficulty level selected. For example, if easy mode is selected, questions from the list containing the easy mode questions will be asked. . Algorithm Implementation . A way I can implement an algorithm is by including a percent representing how many questions the user got correct without selecting an incorrect answer. . Testing . To test the project, I will run all three difficult modes and test whether the point system works. I will also make sure that the game ends and displays the final score when the timer ends. .",

Since you are given an unlimited number of attempts, there is no score given after the quiz is completed. When an incorrect answer is chosen, the user will be taken to a screen telling them they got the question incorrect and they need to try again. When the correct answer is chosen, the user will be taken to a screen telling them they got the question correct and they will proceed to the next question. Once all the questions have been answered correctly, the user will be taken to the final screen telling them they have have completed the quiz. . Successes . I had many successes while making my animal quiz. One success that I had was that I was able to add many images that related to the questions. These images will not only add more to my quiz, but they also make the quiz more entertaining. Another success I had was using buttons to allow the user to advance through the quiz. I like the use of buttons because they are a much cleaner way of selecting an answer than just clicking an image (method used in teacher’s example). . Challenges . Not only did I have many successes, but I also had a few challenges while making the quiz. My biggest challenge was trying to figure out how I should make my incorrect and correct systems. Finally, I decided to make incorrect and correct screens for each question that appeared depending on whether the user gets the question correct or incorrect. Another challenge that I had was with finding images with a transparent background. After watching a video explaining how to find images with transparent backgrounds on Google, I was able to good images that worked well with my quiz. . Discoveries . Throughout my journey of creating my first quiz with JavaScript, I made many discoveries. One discovery I made was that you can personalize your quiz by changing the theme of it. I selected Under the Sea” as my theme. Another discovery that I made was that buttons can be used to progress through different screens. Speaking of screens, I discovered that I could utilize many screens including incorrect screens, correct screens, and screens containing questions and answers. . Link to Quiz .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

          "content": "Variables - A way to store a value. . Data Types - There are many ways to store data like lists and integers. . Assignment Operators - Assignment operators are ways to compare variables. . Managing Complexity with Variables: . Lists - Variable type to store a series of values. . 2D Lists - A list inside of a list. . Dictionaries - A collection of keys and values. . Class - The template for a definition of a method or function. . Algorithms - A set of rules in a program . Sequence - Logical steps in a program that are to be executed in order. . Selection - Selection can be seen in if statements where the computer has to decide between choices. . Iteration - Repeating a process for a certain amount of repetitions. . Expressions - A combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted to create a new value. . Comparison Operators - Comparing two values (like =, &lt;, &gt;, ≤, ≥) . Booleans Expressions and Selection - Using booleans to select subsets of data. . Booleans Expressions and Iteration - Using booleans to iterate through a loop. . Truth Tables - A truth tables lists all the possible truth values depending on the logical operator. . Strings - A type of variable that stores a series of letters . Length - The length of something like a list is how many elements are present in the list. . Concatenation - Combining 2 or more strings together. . Upper - The maximum value. . Lower - The minimum value . Traversing Strings - Going through every character in a string. . Python If - An if statement is a conditional statement where the code following it will only be run if the codition is met . Elif - This is similar to an if statement but it is only used after an if statement. . Else conditionals - If the condition for an if statement is not met and an else statement is present directly after, the else statement will be run. . Nested Selection Statements - When one statement is dependent on if the other statement is run. . For loops - A for loop is a loop a repeats for a certain number of times . While loops - While loops loop through the code inside them until the condition is false. . Break - When a break statement is run, the loop is exited. . Continue - When a continue statement is run, the next iteration of the loop is run. . Procedural Abstraction: . Python Def procedures - A procedure is a group of code that is given a name that works together to serve a purpose. . Parameters - A parameter is something that a function needs to take in to work properly. . Return Values - This is something that a function returns to be used later in a program. .",
