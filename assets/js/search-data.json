            "content": "Why I wasn’t able to complete AWS requirements for this week: . The main error that I wasn’t able to get past was with running the command “sudo docker-compose up -d”. When I ran this command, I received a parsing error which means that the software can’t understand what i’m trying to do. This means that there is either something wrong with my formatting or the code. . Checking for Formatting Issues: . I searched up the error I received and read through a few forums on Stack Overflow. While reading through the comments, I noticed that most people were receiving the parsing error because they had unnecessary spaces in their code. . A few Methods I used to Check for any Unnecessary Spaces: . I even ran my code through a YAML validator to make sure there weren’t any mistakes in my code that violate syntax or incorrect indentations. . I even used the vi command to open a text editor. After creating it, I typed so I could see if there are any spaces that need to be removed. However, there weren’t any unnecessary spaces in the code. . Checking for Mistakes in my Code: . To check for mistakes in my code, I made sure to copy the correct template for the code and change the things that were needed to be changed. I changed the port number, the image name, and I added the directory to my project. I also checked with a few friends to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. . Asking Teacher for Help: . When I asked Mr Yeung for help, he told me to use the “sudo nano config,yml” command to edit the config.yml file and fix any problems in the code without using VSCode. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get my problem resolved because class was ending and he needed to leave. .",

First, an idea is formed The program idea has a purpose and will be programmed for that specific purpose | A plan is created and specific steps are followed | Sometimes the development is exploratory and steps are dictated by what happens | . | Developers need to investigate the problem/purpose and reflect upon it Developers must follow requirements and constraints of the program and also the users interests with the program | Developers can investigate through the use of surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming, storyboarding the program, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and developing a testing strategy | Developers decide on program requirements that describe how the program should behave and includes a list of user interactions | Developers will test small parts (modules) of the program to make sure they are working before putting them together | Developers test the program at the micro (individual components) and macro (individual components working together as intended) levels | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . How is a Program Developed (Video 2)? . Programs are usually developed by teams of people so many inputs and ideas can be provided. Also different people are good at different tasks making team development the obvious choice of development. | Individuals/groups work on different functional components | Every member of the project needs to receive credit for their contributions Their names and contributions must be written in the documentation of the program | . | Many programs give credit through the use of comments because this makes it easy to find out and contact people in charge of a specific part of the code when there is a bug in that code segment | Many times developers use code segments, procedures, and algorithms that are written by people that are not involved in the project just so they don’t have to figure out how to do it themselves (think “there’s no point in reinventing the wheel”) The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | . | .

The reason why this course performed so well was because many students were having trouble dealing with their stress and anxiety | . | Important insights that students can take away from the course: Your level of well being can be improved through the correct practices and measures taken to improve it. | We think that our life circumstances (such as occupation and salary) matter a lot, but they don’t matter nearly as much as we think | Sleep is very important for brain development and well being (and high school and college students aren’t getting enough) | It’s important to be aware of the present moment because it enables you to notice and enjoy the good things in your life. This can be practiced with practices like meditation. | It’s important to prioritize time over money | . | .",

            "title": "Create Performance Task",
            "content": "Program Purpose and Function . An idea I came up with for the Create Performance Task project is a Math Quiz game. In this game there will be three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. There will be a random math question (based on difficulty selected) shown at the top of the screen. Below the question, there will be many boxes (one of them containing the answer) scattered across the screen. Every time you select the correct answer, you get 1000 points (for getting the question right) and the screen changes to show the next question. You can get the questions wrong infinite times, but each time you select and incorrect answer, your total score will decrease by 100 points. There will be a timer in the corner of the screen showing the amount of time left until the game ends. The goal of the game is to get the most points that you can. . Data Abstraction . Many variables will be used to store different values in the program. Some variables that will be very useful are a variable for the score, a variable for the timer, variables for the answers scattered across the screen, and variables for the lists for each difficulty. . Managing Complexity . To manage the complexity of my code, I will add the questions into a list and randomly generate questions from the list. There will be a list for each difficulty level. . Procedural Abstraction . To manage the difficulty, there will be three different buttons to select how hard the user wants the quiz to be. The list that will be accessed during the quiz depends on the difficulty level selected. For example, if easy mode is selected, questions from the list containing the easy mode questions will be asked. . Algorithm Implementation . A way I can implement an algorithm is by including a percent representing how many questions the user got correct without selecting an incorrect answer. . Testing . To test the project, I will run all three difficult modes and test whether the point system works. I will also make sure that the game ends and displays the final score when the timer ends. .",

Since you are given an unlimited number of attempts, there is no score given after the quiz is completed. When an incorrect answer is chosen, the user will be taken to a screen telling them they got the question incorrect and they need to try again. When the correct answer is chosen, the user will be taken to a screen telling them they got the question correct and they will proceed to the next question. Once all the questions have been answered correctly, the user will be taken to the final screen telling them they have have completed the quiz. . Successes . I had many successes while making my animal quiz. One success that I had was that I was able to add many images that related to the questions. These images will not only add more to my quiz, but they also make the quiz more entertaining. Another success I had was using buttons to allow the user to advance through the quiz. I like the use of buttons because they are a much cleaner way of selecting an answer than just clicking an image (method used in teacher’s example). . Challenges . Not only did I have many successes, but I also had a few challenges while making the quiz. My biggest challenge was trying to figure out how I should make my incorrect and correct systems. Finally, I decided to make incorrect and correct screens for each question that appeared depending on whether the user gets the question correct or incorrect. Another challenge that I had was with finding images with a transparent background. After watching a video explaining how to find images with transparent backgrounds on Google, I was able to good images that worked well with my quiz. . Discoveries . Throughout my journey of creating my first quiz with JavaScript, I made many discoveries. One discovery I made was that you can personalize your quiz by changing the theme of it. I selected Under the Sea” as my theme. Another discovery that I made was that buttons can be used to progress through different screens. Speaking of screens, I discovered that I could utilize many screens including incorrect screens, correct screens, and screens containing questions and answers. . Link to Quiz .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown.
