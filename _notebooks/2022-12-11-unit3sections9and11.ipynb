    "Since this list is already ordered from least to greatest, we can skip this step. To find the number 69 in the list in question 4, we would first start by finding the middle element. Since there are an even number of elements in this list, there would be no middle element, so we would use the next element from the middle of the list which in this case would be 6. Since 6 is less than 69, we know that 69 is in the second half of the list with all the numbers greater than 6. Since the middle element of this half is 11 and is less than 69, we know that the number 69 is in the part of the list after the element 11. Since there is only one element in this part of the list, we know that this element is 69 and we have found the desired value 69."

Sequential is usually less efficient because if the desired element is towards the end of the list or the list is very long, all the previous elements would have to be checked before reaching the desired element. Therefore, sequential search usually takes more checks to reach the desired value than binary search."
