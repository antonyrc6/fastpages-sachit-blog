Hello, my name is Sachit and this is my blog. I am learning to work with VSCode, Git, and Jupyter.

This is my site built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.

[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.  A full list of features can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).
