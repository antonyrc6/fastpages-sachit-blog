### Submission 1

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | My Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function  | 0/1    | 0/1    | Even though the written response and the video include the inputs and outputs of the program, the purpose of the program is not explained.     |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction  | 1/1    | 0/1    | The student's list has more than one item and it serves an important purpose in the program. This purpose is also explained in the written response.    |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  | 0/1    | 0/1    | The written response states that the list makes the program more complex.    |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction  | 1/1    | 0/1    | The student included a function from their code in the written response that takes in 1 parameter. The student also shows that it's called later in the program. The student describes the functionality of the program.    |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation  | 0/1    | 0/1    | Even though the program includes sequencing, iteration, and selection, the written response is not descriptive enough and does not provide enough information to be recreated.    |
| Row 6: Testing  | 1/1    | 1/1    | Response includes 2 calls with different conditions being tested.    |


### Submission 2

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | My Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The video and written response show the inputs and their outputs along with the program's functionality by showing how the user interacts with the program.    |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The list contains more than one item and the data contained in the list is explained in the written response. The list also fulfills the program's purpose.    |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response includes how the list manages complexity and how the program could be made different but less efficient without the list.    |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response includes a function with at least one parameter and explains how it contributes to the program's overall functionality. The written response also show the function being called.    |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response contains an algorithm with sequencing, iteration, and selection. The response also includes what this algorithm does and how it does it.    |
| Row 6: Testing  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response includes the 2 calls, the conditions being tested in each call, and the results of each call.   |

### Submission 3

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | My Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function  | 1/1    | 0/1    | The student included the inputs, outputs, and functionality of the program in their video and written response. The way the user interacts with the program is also shown.    |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The list contains more than one element and the written response explains how the list fulfills the program's purpose.    |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response explains that the list manages complexity by explaining how a different way without the list would not be efficient and would be too complex.    |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response includes a procedure with at least one parameter and explains how it adds to the program's functionality.    |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The algorithm in the written response includes iteration with a for loop, selection with an if statement, and sequencing. The algorithm is also explained in enough detailed for it to be recreated.    |
| Row 6: Testing  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response explains the calls, shows the outputs of each call, and explains the conditions being tested in each call.    |

### Submission 4

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | My Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The student explained the functionality and purpose of their code in the written response and the video.    |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction  | 0/1    | 0/1    | The list shown includes more than one element, but the written response doesn't include how it fulfills the program's purpose.    |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  | 1/1    | 0/1    | The written response explains how the list manages complexity and gives us a different approach for the algorithm that would be less efficient and wouldn't use the list.    |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The student developed procedure shown in the written response contains at least one parameter and shows where it is called. The written response also explains how the procedure adds to the program's overall functionality.    |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response includes an algorithm that has selection (with an if statement), iteration (with a for loop), and sequencing. The student also describes the algorithm in detailed steps.    |
| Row 6: Testing  | 1/1    | 0/1    | The written response includes the two calls, the conditions being tested, and the outputs of each call.    |

### Reflection

Just like last time, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I was surprised with how College Board decided to grade some of the categories and that their scoring different from mine at times. With this assignment, I think I learned a lot about the different categories College Board uses to grade the performance tasks. Also, I came to realize that it takes a lot of work to grade the performance tasks because one small error can result in a 0. This made it challenging to figure out whether the category should receive a 0 or a 1. With the 2 create performance task grading assignments I have completed, I have a greater understanding of what it takes to fulfill the requirements of each category and how selective College Board is with their grading.
