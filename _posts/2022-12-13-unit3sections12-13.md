# 3.12 Hacks Part 1

### Problem 1:

Answer: PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) }

This is the answer because both distance and time are needed and the value of distance/time needs to be calculated to determine the average speed.

### Problem 2:

Answer: **True**, nothing will be displayed

Even though volume have the value of IM MAD!!!, nothing will be displayed because they is no DISPLAY() statement.

### Problem 3:

Answer: The correct answers are code snippets 1 and 4.

Code snippet 1 is correct because it directly adds the carbon footprints from each flight to get the total carbon footprint.

Code snippet 4 is also correct because it assigns each carbon footprint to a variable which are then added together to get the total carbon footprint.

# 3.12 Hacks Part 2

### Problem 1:

Answer: The value of a is 729.

First, the value of b is found by multiplying 9 and 9 which is 81. Next, the value of a is found by multiply the value of b and c together which is 81 x 9 which is **729**.

### Problem 2:

"cost ‚üµ 173 tax - 10%" was written poorly and was very confusing. At first I thought cost was assigned to the entire value on the right. But after a long time of getting confused, I realized cost was assigned to 173 and tax was assigned to 10%.

Answer: The cost is 190.3

First, we know that temp is 100 + percentTaxed which is 110. Next, temp is assigned to temp/100 which is 110/100 which is 1.1. Lastly, cost is equal to the previously given value of cost multiplied by the new value for temp which gives us a value of 190.3 (173 x 1.1) for cost.

### Problem 3: 

Answer: The temperature in celsius is about 39.4 degrees Celsius.

First, Celsius is set to the value of temperature - 32 which is 71. Next, Celsius is set to the value of Celsius x 5/9 which is about 39.4.

# 3.13 Hacks Parts 1 and 2

### Problem 1:

PROCEDURE CurrentHighest(currentrbyards, totalGames, toprbyardspg) {

currentrbyardspg <-- currentrbyards/totalGames

IF currentrbyardspg > toprbyardspg {

toprbyardspg <-- currentrbyardspg

}

return(toprbyardspg)

}

DISPLAY(CurrentHighest(1260, 12, 100))

### Problem 2:

PROCEDURE MoveAPlus {

move_forward()

rotate_left()

move_forward()

move_forward()

rotate_right()

move_forward()

move_forward()

move_forward()

rotate_left()

move_forward()

move_forward()

rotate_left()

move_forward()

move_forward()

rotate_right()

move_forward()

rotate_left()

move_forward()

move_forward()

}

### Problem 3:

Answer: B. PROCEDURE MyList

This is the correct answer because "procedure" needs to be in all caps and only part of the name of the procedure should be in caps.

### Problem 4:

Assuming beach ball starts facing forward:

PROCEDURE MoveBeachBall {

rotate_left()

move_forward()

rotate_right()

repeat 6 times {

move_forward()

}

rotate_left()

move_forward()

move_forward()

}
