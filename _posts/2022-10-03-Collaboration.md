## Collaboration

- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function
- A computing innovation can be physical, nonphysical computing software, or a nonphysical computing concept
- Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations
- Interpersonal skills learned through collaboration: Communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation

## How to Collaborate in Class

- Pair Programming: When two programmers work together as a pair. One person (the driver) writes the code while the other person (the observer, pointer, or navigator) reviews the code as it's typed.
- Think-Pair-Share: In this process, students first think through the problem by themselves, share with a partner, and share with the whole class.
- Comments
    - Communicate to yourself and your partner
    - Acknowledge code segments and media used from other sources
    - Differentiate contributions from all members of the group or pair
    - Clarify functionality of code
- Online tools that allow programmers to collaborate: repl.it, GitHub, or a shared document or folder
