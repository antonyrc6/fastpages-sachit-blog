# Frontend

### Frontend Function

Line Numbers: 105 - 206

### Error Testing

Overview: In order to prevent garbage input from getting executed in my code, I created this if statement to check if the "city" inputted is valid and if it's in the RapidAPI API.

# Backend

### Backend API Model

Overview: My API model serves as a model for my API to reference. To make this, I adjusted Mr. Mortensen's code to my own project's needs.

### Backend API

Overview: This API uses the API model as a structure for itself. This API includes the create and read functions that I made for me to be able to display the data in the API and add more data to it.
