### Introduction: 

Even though I didn't get any question wrong on this test, I wanted to talk about some question that I found challenging.

### Question 45:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q45.png "Question 45")

For this question, I wasn't sure what the word "heuristic" meant because I had never heard it before. After searching up what it means, I chose the answer that made the most sense with what I had just learned.

### Question 50:

For this question, I knew that it was asking me to convert hexadecimal (base 16) number 56 to decimal, but I didn't know how to do this without using a calculator. With a calculator, I found that the decimal value is 86 which corresponds to the letter V.

### Reflection:

Overall, I found this quiz to be pretty easy and I understood all the topics I was tested on. Although I found a few problems challenging (the problems I listed above), I was able to understand even these questions. I also found it fun to solve these problems because they made me use my brain and challenged me a little.
