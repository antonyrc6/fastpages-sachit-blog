### Big Idea 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects Reflection

**1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing**

- Simulations:
    - Beneficial: Simulations are beneficial because they allow us to use previously collected data to simulate possible outcomes for something.
    - Harmful Effects: In some cases, simulations might not account for every detail which might create a crucial miscalculation in the results (very rare).
- Smartphones:
    - Beneficial: Smartphones are beneficial because they are portable and they provide us with easy access to a lot of information.
    - Harmful Effects: One harmful effect of smartphones is that they can be addicting. With the numerous apps created solely for the purpose of entertainment, it's very easy for one to get addicted to their phone. Especially with the rise of social media, more and more people are glued to their phones.
- Social Media:
    - Beneficial: With social media, people can meet and make friends online and stay connected with their friends.
    - Harmful Effects: Like I mentioned before, social media is very addictive. Many people have an uncontrollable urge to constantly check their phone for notifications from social media platforms. Social media can also take away from real in person relationships when people are always on their phones.

**2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**

Dopamine issues are absolutely real and are a big problem. Problems with dopamine are affecting countless people around the world. For example, Anthony Rosner, who was 17 years old, had an addiction of playing World of Warcraft. He spent up to 18 hours a day, every day playing this game. This went on for nearly 2 years. This addiction led him to neglect his schoolwork, relationships, health, and even his hygiene. We can see that in this person's case, this dopamine issue resulted in a negative impact on Rosner's studies and success in high school.
