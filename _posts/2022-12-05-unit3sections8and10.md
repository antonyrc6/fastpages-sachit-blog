# What you need to do
### [Exercises](https://pgk-lang.github.io/pgk/exercises)
 1. Complete the exercises and add screenshots of your completed code to your blog
   - Reflect on what you learned
 
### [Multiple Choice quiz](https://pgk-lang.github.io/pgk/quiz)
 1. Complete the quiz and add screenshots of the questions you got wrong to your blog
   - Reflect on what you learned
   - If you got everything correct, look at the [javascript code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PGK-Lang/pgk/master/_pages/01_quiz.md) used to create the quiz and explain how the use of lists and iteration helps to make the code more efficient

Reflecting on what I learned: While taking this multiple choice quiz, I used what I had learned from your presentation on sections 8 and 10 to get almost all the questions correct. The only question I got wrong was question 9 which asked "I want to iterate over a list until the user inputs 'quit'. What loop would I use?". I still don't understand why the answer to this question is "FOR loops" because since the loop will iterate over a list until the user inputs 'quit', this represents a while loop because the loop ends when a condition is met. A for loop would make sense for a situation where something is repeated a certain number of times.
