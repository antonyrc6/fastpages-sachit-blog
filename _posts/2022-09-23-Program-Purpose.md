## Computing Innovations

- A computing innovation is an that includes a computer or program code as an essential part of its functionality.
- Categories of computing innovations:
    - Applications (games, social media, etc.)
    - Physical Devices (computers, smart phones, etc.)
    - Systems (e-mail, cloud services, e-commerce, etc.)
- Purpose of computing innovations: The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to purse interests through creative expression.
- Important questions to understanding the purpose of a computing innovation:
    - Why does the computing innovation exist?
    - What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve?
    - What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before?
- Importance of understand purpose of a computing innovation: An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation gives developers an improved ability to develop that computing innovation and improve on it.

## What is a Program?

- A program is a collection of statements
- A statement is a single command
- A code segment is a group of statements
- They way a code segment is executed can vary depending on the programming language
- Software is often referred to as software


## Identifying Inputs and Outputs in a Program

- Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms:
    - Tactile (touch)
    - Audio
    - Visual
    - Text (including numerical values)
- Most programs are written in an event driven environment.
    - Events are triggered by an actions that sends input to the program
- Outputs that can be produced by a device:
    - Visual
    - Audio
    - Tactile (touch/feel)
    - Text
- How does a program know what to do upon receiving an event?
    - First the program jumps to the code segment that is connected with the what was inputted
    - Next, the code segment is executed
    - Code in code segment produces an output
