Week 1 Table:

|    | Unit 3 Sections 1 - 2  | Unit 3 Sections 3 - 4 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Score    | 1       |  0.95    |
| What I Learned and Practiced | In unit 3 sections 1 - 2, I didn't really learn anything, but I had tons of practice. One thing I practiced was assigning different variables to different values and setting variable equal to each other. I also practiced predicting what would be displayed after all the rearranging. I also practiced converting decimal to binary and binary to decimal.   |  In unit 3 sections 3 - 4, I learned about sequencing, iteration, and selection. I also practiced using substrings and concatenation to work through practice problems. Lastly, I practiced setting variables to different number values and adding the variables to together and to each other to get different numbers assigned to the variables.  |

Week 2 Table:

|    | Unit 3 Sections 5 - 7  | Unit 3 Sections 8 and 10 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Score    | 1       |  0.9    |
| What I Learned and Practiced | In unit 3 sections 5 - 7, there were more problems about converting from binary to decimal and vice versa. We also learned about Not operator, AND operator, and OR operator truth tables. We also learned how to make a flowchart to represent a situation. We also learned how to create dictionaries.   |  In unit 3 sections 8 and 10, I was able to use bubble sort to sort a list. I also learned how to reverse a list without using the already made reverse function in python. I also learned about while and for loops and the difference between them.|
