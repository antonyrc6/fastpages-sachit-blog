| What I Learned and Practiced | In unit 3 sections 1 - 2, I didn't really learn anything, but I had tons of practice. One thing I practiced was assigning different variables to different values and setting variable equal to each other. I also practiced predicting what would be displayed after all the rearranging. I also practiced converting decimal to binary and binary to decimal.   |  In unit 3 sections 3 - 4, I learned about sequencing, iteration, and selection. I also practiced using substrings and concatenation to work through practice problems. Lastly, I practiced setting variables to different number values and adding the variables to together and to each other to get different numbers assigned to the variables.  |
