### Introduction: 

This test, I was able to get 48/50 questions correct. I think this is a good score and I am proud of myself for getting it. Throughout the remainder of this blog I will correct my mistakes and reflect upon what I learned from this test.

### Question 2:

For this question, I didn't really understand what cookies are and what their importance is. I also understood that if someone gets a hold of your IP address, this can cause a lot of trouble. Because of this prior knowledge I had about IP addresses, I thought that someone getting hold of the IP address of the user's computer would have the greatest potential to compromise the user's privacy. The answer states that A ("A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser") is the correct answer because the information stored in browser cookies can be used by the websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about them. It also states that the answer I selected ("The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer") is incorrect because the IP address itself doesn't contain a lot of private information about the user and it's needed for the user to send and receive information on the Internet.

### Question 49:

I'm still not sure why the answer I selected is considered incorrect, but I understand why the correct answer is correct. The reasoning given by College Board states that the answer is B ("The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement.") because it's impossible to get every detail for a situation and implement them into a simulation. Instead, simulations are designed to incorporate the most important details to make them as accurate as possible. The reason why I selected D ("Running a simulation requires a large number of observations to be collected before it can be used to explore a problem.") is because I thought that simulations had to use data from other similar events to predict what would happen. Even though I still believe this could be a possible answer, I completely understand why the answer given in the answer key is correct.

### Reflection:

Overall, I found this quiz to be pretty straightforward and I understood and correctly answered most of the questions. Even though there were a few questions I got wrong, I was able to understand why I got them wrong and why the answer listed in the answer key is correct after review. Just like with the previous MCQ tests, I found it fun to solve these problems because they are kind of like puzzles.
