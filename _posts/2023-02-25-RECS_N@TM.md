### Night at the Museum Info

Just like in trimester 1, the idea of the Night at the museum is the same. Night at the museum is a day where people can art pieces from different art classes are presented for people to see and admire. These pieces set on display are the culmination of lots of hard work and dedication put in by many students. This day is purposed to showing off the accomplishments of these students.

### My experience at Night at the Museum

The first class I explored was computer animation. Most of the projects displayed where scenes created by students related to donuts. There were many cool scenes created that I found interesting. Here are some examples:

Another class I went to was studio art. There were many different paintings and art pieces hung around the room. Some of these painting looked like they were created by professional artists. I couldn't believe that students could make such beautiful works of art. Here is one of my favorite paintings that I found truly fascinating:

Next, I went to the ceramics classroom to see what students in that class created. Here, there were many sculptures about different things ranging from animals to common objects. Here is one of my favorites shown below:

I also had a chance to take a look at pictures taken for the photography class. These pictures captured scenes like landscapes, close-ups of various objects, and selfies. The picture I found most alluring was a picture of a duck swimming in golden water (the water is gold because of the light from the sun):

The class I visited that was unlike the others was jazz as it focuses on auditory art rather than visual art. Since I am in band, I have a little experience in music and I truly enjoyed listening to the jazz music. I could tell that the student musicians were talented and worked hard to become so good. Since I visited this class with my friend Edwin, I took a picture of him in front of the jazz performers:

Lastly, I also was able to see what other groups in CSP and CSA were working on. I was surprised by how good these projects were and how hard these students must have worked on them. Their projects functioned as intended and looked appealing and well made. Here are some of the projects I had a chance to view:

### Reflection

Overall, I not only had a fun time presenting what I had worked on with my project, but I also had fun seeing other computer science projects and art from an assortment of other classes. Some of my favorite classes that I visited were photography, jazz, and studio art. I had a good time and I hope I could have an experience like this again in the future.
