### Introduction: 

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/BigIdea2Score.png "Big Idea 2 Quiz Score")

This quiz, I was able to get 25/25 questions correct. I was able to get a good score on this quiz after watching the big idea 2 videos and doing well on the practice quizzes of big idea 2. With this practice and the knowledge I obtained from these videos and quizzes, I was able to do good on this quiz.

# Questions I Found Challenging:

I didn't find any questions particularly challenging as they were all about topics I had either learned about in big idea 2 or topics I already knew about from before. Also, there weren't many questions where silly mistakes could be made as compared to other quizzes and tests where making a small error could result in the entire question being answered wrong. I would have talked about and explained a few questions that I found challenging in the quiz, but I didn't find any questions very challenging or noteworthy to talk about.

### Reflection:

Overall, I found this quiz to be pretty doable and there weren't any questions that confused me or gave me a hard time. And as a result, I correctly answer the questions. Additionally, another factor that contributed to me doing good on this quiz was that some of the questions were reused from the other big idea 2 practice quizzes. Since I remembered what I put as answers for these questions, I wouldn't be able to get these questions wrong. And of the remaining questions that weren't from other practice quizzes, they weren't too difficult and I was able to figure the answers to them.
