### Submission 1

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | My Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function  | 0/1    | 0/1    | They explained the functionality and purpose of their code. These were also shown in the video. However, the student describes the functionality of their program similarly to how they describe its purpose.    |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The student states in their written response that there is a list containing all possible triangle types and a specific element is called from the list using the side lengths of the inputted triangle.    |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  | 1/1    | 0/1    | The code was organized with the use of functions and for loops.    |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The student included a function from their code in the written response that takes in more than 1 parameter. The student also explains what the function does and how it contributes to the functionality of the program.    |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation  | 1/1    | 1/1    | Includes an algorithm and explains what it does and how it does it. The algorithm included contains sequencing, iteration, and selection.    |
| Row 6: Testing  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response has the conditions being tested in each call and the result from each call.    |


### Submission 2

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The video shows the inputs, outputs, and how the user interacts with the program.    |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The lists are not one element lists. The lists help the program reach its purpose and are important to the program.    |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response shows how the list manages complexity and explains its importance.    |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | There are code segments that show the procedure itself and where it's called. The procedure has more than 1 parameter (needs at least one). The procedure is related to the rest of the program.    |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation  | 1/1    | 1/1    | There is sequencing, iteration, and selection present in the code segment. The explanation of the code segment is very detailed.    |
| Row 6: Testing  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The written response contains which conditions are being tested each call and the results of each call.    |

### Reflection

Overall, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. After looking at these performance tasks and seeing how College Board graded them with their rubric, I can see how careful you have to be about meeting each and every requirement on the rubric. Even if you miss one small thing, you won't receive any credit for the category. Knowing this, I will be sure to review the rubric many times to make sure my performance task has everything it needs to score well. I also wanted to mention that I think that both of these examples were really well made.
