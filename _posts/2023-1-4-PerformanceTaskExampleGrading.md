### Submission 1

| Category | My Score | College Board Score | My Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function  | 0/1    | 0/1    | They explained the functionality and purpose of their code. These were also shown in the video. However, the student describes the functionality of their program similarly to how they describe its purpose.    |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The student states in their written response that there is a list containing all possible triangle types and a specific element is called from the list using the side lengths of the inputted triangle.    |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  | 1/1    | 0/1    | The code was organized with the use of functions and for loops.    |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The student included a function from their code in the written response that takes in more than 1 parameter. The student also explains what the function does and how it contributes to the functionality of the program.    |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation  | 1/1    | 1/1    | Includes an algorithm and explains what it does and how it does it. The algorithm included contains sequencing, iteration, and selection.    |
| Row 6: Testing  | 1/1    | 1/1    | The program worked in the way it was described in the written response.    |
