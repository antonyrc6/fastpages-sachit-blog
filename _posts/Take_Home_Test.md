### My Experience Taking the Test

Before taking the test, I reviewed all the previous multiple choice quizzes that we have taken before to remember what I had learned. Many of the questions were the same as the questions, so reviewing the quizzes really helped. A topic I wasn't expecting to see on the test was bits. I had learned a little bit about this in the past, so I was able to use this basic knowledge to answer these questions.
