### Introduction

Although my CPT project is almost complete, there are still a few more things I need to complete before the AP exam.

### Things I need to do Before Submitting

1. I need to personalize my project more before submitting it to make it different from other classmate's projects. I have worked on this a little, but I need to personalize my project a lot more before submitting it to College Board.

2. I also need to review my project, the write up I created for it, and the video I created for it and make sure it aligns with College Board's requirements. I think my video is fine, but I might need to make some edits to my write up because I don't think my reasoning for each question is good.

### Reflection

The things listed above are what I need to work on for the next month. After doing these things, I should be set for the CPT project part of the AP exam.
