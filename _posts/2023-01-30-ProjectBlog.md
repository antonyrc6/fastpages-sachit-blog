### Our Project

Our project flight booking site where users can book a flight to see a building they want to visit. We will provide users with different buildings and information about them so they can decide where they want to go.

### Part of the Project Used

My Create Performance Task project will be about the part of our group project where we find the closest airport to the building the user wants to visit.

### Video Plan

In the video, I will show 2 runs of the program with 2 different conditions being tested in each. In the first run, I will choose a building for which there is a nearby airport. In the second run, I will choose a building where the airport is far away.
