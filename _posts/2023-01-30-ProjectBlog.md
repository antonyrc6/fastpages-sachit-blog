### Our Project

Our project flight booking site where users can book a flight to see a building they want to visit. We will provide users with different buildings and information about them so they can decide where they want to go.

### Part of the Project Used

My Create Performance Task project will be about the part of our group project where we find the closest airport to the building the user wants to visit.

### Code Plan

My code will use a function to compare the user's selected building with airports nearby to find out which airport is nearest to the building the user selected. My code will also use a list to store the possible nearby airports near the building the user selected. I will also use KNN algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm) to find the nearest airport to the user's selected building.

### Video Plan

In the video, I will show 2 runs of the program with 2 different conditions being tested in each. In the first run, I will choose a building for which there is a nearby airport. In the second run, I will choose a building where the airport is far away.
